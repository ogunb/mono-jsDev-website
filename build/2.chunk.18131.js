Rennie RPG was my first big project and I was getting familiar with HTML, CSS, jQuery (vanilla js was a scary thing for me back in the days.). It was a fun experience.\n\nAnyone can have the source files, as they are just prototypes and don't include any sensitive information.\n\n[Live Protoype](https://ogunb.github.io/rennie-landing/dist/index.html)"}});
