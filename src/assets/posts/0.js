export default `# Rennie Gaming: SA-MP Server.

I designed and developed front-end of the Rennie RPG's landing page, user/game panel, community forum back in **April(?) 2017**.

Rennie RPG was my first big project and I was getting familiar with HTML, CSS, jQuery (vanilla js was a scary thing for me back in the days.). It was a fun experience.

Anyone can have the source files, as they are just prototypes and don't include any sensitive information.
